# intuitive-clock

Problem: i kept losing track of time, especially when im brainrotting so i needed some way to visually and intuitively see how much time had passed, instead of seeing a number and needing to do math in my brain to calculate how much time i had used up
Solution: this clock thing!! the outer ring fills up once a day, with the color of the sky! the middle ring is for the hour, and it slowly changes color as it fills up. the inner one shows each second that passes
